Hero is not just a superhero film, but also a vigilante film that takes on the corrupt education system in India. The film exposes how some greedy businessmen exploit the dreams of innocent students and parents by selling them fake certificates and degrees. The film also highlights how the education system kills the creativity and innovation of young minds by forcing them to follow a rigid curriculum and rote learning.
 
The film has a strong message and a relevant theme, but suffers from a weak screenplay and execution. The film tries to be both a superhero film and a vigilante film, but fails to balance both genres effectively. The film has some engaging moments, especially in the first half, where we see Sakthi's transformation from a fraudster to a fighter. The scenes involving Sakthi and Sathyamoorthy, his mentor and inspiration, are well-written and performed. The film also has some impressive action sequences and visual effects that add to the thrill.
 
However, the film loses steam in the second half, where it becomes predictable and preachy. The film relies too much on dialogues and monologues to convey its message, rather than showing it through actions. The film also has some logical loopholes and inconsistencies that affect the credibility of the plot. The film's villain, Mahadev, played by Abhay Deol, is underdeveloped and lacks menace. The film's climax is also disappointing and anti-climactic.
 
Hero has some good performances from its lead actors. Sivakarthikeyan delivers a sincere and earnest performance as Sakthi, and shows his versatility as an actor. He carries the film on his shoulders with his charm and charisma. Arjun Sarja is excellent as Sathyamoorthy, the idealistic teacher who inspires Sakthi to become a hero. He brings dignity and grace to his role. Abhay Deol is decent as Mahadev, but is let down by his poorly written character. Kalyani Priyadarshan is cute as Meera, Sakthi's love interest, but has little scope to perform. Ivana is impressive as Mathi, Sakthi's friend and protÃ©gÃ©.
 
Hero has a good soundtrack by Yuvan Shankar Raja, who elevates the mood of the film with his background score. The songs are catchy and well-placed in the film. The cinematography by George C. Williams is crisp and vibrant, capturing the action and emotions of the film effectively. The editing by Ruben is smooth and slick, keeping the pace of the film steady.
 
Hero is a fairly good vigilante film that exposes the flaws of the education system, but a middling superhero film that lacks originality and excitement. It is a one-time watch for Sivakarthikeyan and Arjun fans.
